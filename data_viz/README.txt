HANDIN: This is my final handin, I do not intend to resumbit

barchart.html:

I decided to use the video games dataset to mimic the demo, since I wanted to have each chart to have a 
fraction/total split, and with this I could do a North America/Total Sales representation, while selecting
video games which had a substantial Noth American sales that was worth visualizing.

graphs.py:

My first chart was a piechart for Pikachu's fighting skills split, since the data was both simple and logically made
sense to be visualised as an attribute split since each of the 6 attributes added up exactly to the total.

My second chart was a histogram (not to be confused with a bar-chart), where I wanted to visualize the distributon of
overall fighting skill across the entire Pokemon dataset, with 10 data points . I labelled my y-axis as the number of
pokemon since I wanted to know the exact numbers, although using frequency (normalised out of 1) may be more relevant
for checking how close it is to a normal distributon.

NOTE: I was told be a TA that my histogram was fine and would not be considered a barchart
