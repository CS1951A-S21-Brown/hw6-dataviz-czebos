        Questions: <br />
        1. My boss wants to know the number of games played by year, and include at least 5 years. <br />
        I have included 5 years to choose from, and to see the number of years played by a team, you may<br />
        hover over a circle. The total games played is also at the top of the infographic. The infographic <br />
        also displays the proximity of games played and the relationship between teams and games played amongst them.<br /> <br />
        He also wants to know the top winning nations. The second infographic shows the winning percentage for only <br />
        the top 10 nations. The color is highlighted more green for a higher winning percentage. If you hover over <br />
        a country, it also displays the exact win percentage. <br /> <br />
        Finally, my boss wants to know what nation to bet on. The last infographic shows the score differential by games played in the world cup.<br />
        It is ordered from best 75 percentaile to worst, so you can see how often they perform well. This <br />
        is displayed over the last two world cups, so we can see who is top performing by score differential. Score <br />
        differential shows how well a team is beating their opponents and by what margin, which is an indicator of success. <br /> <br />
        2. D3 is really helpful in multiple ways. Some of the key ways are its physics engine, <br />
        its scaling, and flexibility in style/graphing ability. The physics engine helps us see correlation <br />
        between nodes and its links (as shown in my first graph). The scaling is great because you can color coordinate <br />
        based on somethings "influence" and adjust how influential the number scaling and color changing is. Finally <br />
        There is so many libraries to choose from and helper functions to make the process even easier. You can create so many types of graphs. <br /> <br />
        3. It is not the most optimal for dealing with large datasets. When I process 1000 points for the first <br />
        infographic, there is lag. With more points, even more lag. The learning curve is very steep. <br />
        Figuring out what all of these functions do and why they do what they do was very confusing for me. <br />
        It would be even worse for a new engineer. Lastly, you're limited to D3. Although it is very expansive of a library, <br />
        There is still potential infographics that could be displayed better or physics engines that one could implement
        themselves to show unique relationships. <br /> <br />
        4. In “A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization,” the article talks about the autonomy <br/>
        of a accesible graph. One of the imporant things that it mentions is that color scheme should be accessible<br />
        to color blind people. In fact, color is not nessesary in my infographics, only the darkness of the color,<br />
        which can be detected by colorblind people. However, some of my font is small, which is not as accessible to someone<br />
        who is hard of seeing. A change I could make going forward is to give larger text for the infographic, but <br />
        also add blurbs that are large in font for people to catch the graphic quickly withe ease. <br /> <br />
        5. Like I said earlier, there should be a start with a focus not on actual color itself. For example, don't <br/>
        rely on color coding, rather use color for scaling. Make things very visible to the hard of seeing when planning. <br/>
        For the neurological accesiblity, adding ways to make information consise and simple is also important. </br>
        Think about all kinds of audiences when designing the infographic. <br/> <br/>

        EXTRA CREDIT: <br/>
        1. I implemented a dynamic stats calculation. This is in the third inforgraphic. <br/>
        When you click the year, it gives you the games played in that World Cup Year, and then <br/>
        retrieves the scored points by each of the teams, categorizes score by team, then calculates <br/>
        the median, max, min, first quartile and third quartile of the score differential, and makes a <br/>
        box and whisker plot out of it. This was one of the examples for extra credit. <br/> <br/>

        2.a In the first graph, I used a flow type graphic. This shows the relationship amongst <br/>
        how teams played other teams. When nodes are closer, they play each other and the closer nodes <br/>
        opposing teams more, creating kind of like league clusters. <br/> <br/>

        2.b In the second graph, I used a map type graphic. This shows the winning percentage for the <br/>
        top 10 nations when you hover over the nation itself.
